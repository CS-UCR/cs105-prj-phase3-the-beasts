# CS 105 - Project Phase 2


# Datasets
We are analyzing data for the Fortune 500 companies across three years (2017, 2018, and 2019). We combined the data from the three years into one single csv file. Usman Ahmed helped to convert all the variables into floats and ints in this data set as well as added an extra column: Year. This helped us keep the data organized.

# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

Three group members: Devang Aggarwal, Luis Chelala and Usman Ahmed performed EDA on the cleaned data. Below is a brief run-down of how the group members split up the work and performed EDA on the data:

# Devang

* Created a histogram which shows the relationship between the top 10 companies on the Fortune 500 list and their average revenues across the three years.
* Created a Parallel Coordinates Plot which showed the relationship between the top 10 companies and the other categorical columns.
* Created a Boxplot which showed the relationship between the top 4 companies and the assets ($millions).
* Created a Scatter plot which showed the relationship between Profits and Revenues.

# Luis

* Created a Scatter plot which showed the relationship between Revenue Change and Market Value.
* Created a graph which showed the relationship between Year and Change in Rank

# Usman

* Performed Data Cleaning
* Created a graph which showed the relationship between Company Name and Profits and Assets.

# Running our code

* Open up hub.cs.ucr.edu or any other environment that allows Jupyter Notebooks.
* Download our python code (cs105_phase2.ipynb) and upload it into hub.cs.ucr.edu or anything equivalent.
* Download our CSV file (CS 105 project.csv) and upload it into hub.cs.ucr.edu or anything equivalent.
* Go on our python file and run all the cells. Start from the top and make your way down.
